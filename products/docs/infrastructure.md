# M0 — Infrastructure Foundation: Technical Design

> **Related PRD:** [`../requirements/infrastructure.md`](../requirements/infrastructure.md)
> **Status:** Draft — awaiting user review

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend language | Node.js 20 + TypeScript |
| API framework | Fastify |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Frontend (placeholder in M0) | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo |
| Cloud | AWS — region `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore) |
| Compute | ECS Fargate (single task, single AZ for M0) |
| Database hosting | RDS Postgres (`db.t4g.micro`, single-AZ) |
| Ingress | Application Load Balancer (HTTP-only in M0 since no custom domain; HTTPS added when a domain attaches in a later milestone) |
| Image registry | ECR |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager |
| Logs | CloudWatch Logs |
| Infrastructure as code | Terraform |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (OIDC; no long-lived AWS keys) |
| Container | Docker (multi-stage build) |

## Architecture

```

## Why these choices

- **Node.js + TypeScript** — same language family as the frontend; minimal cognitive switching while you learn backend.
- **Fastify** — faster and more structured than Express, first-class TypeScript support.
- **Prisma** — declarative schema, auto-generated migrations, type-safe client; easiest SQL ramp for a frontend-first engineer.
- **PostgreSQL** — relational integrity matters for chat (users, conversations, memberships); the default for real apps.
- **ECS Fargate** — managed containers; no servers to patch; scale by replica count.
- **ALB** — standard L7 load balancer; teaches target groups, health checks, request routing.
- **Terraform** — industry-standard IaC; portable to other clouds; better state model than AWS CDK.
- **GitHub Actions + OIDC** — built into GitHub; OIDC means zero AWS keys in repo or CI secrets.
- **AWS region `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore)** — chosen by user (lowest latency for the target user base).

## CI/CD pipeline

**On every pull request**
- Install dependencies (`pnpm install`).
- Lint, type-check, run unit tests.
- `terraform validate` + `terraform plan` (no apply).

**On merge to `main`**
- Everything above.
- Build the API image (multi-stage Docker).
- Push to ECR.
- Update the ECS service to use the new image (rolling deploy).
- Verify the live ALB URL responds to `/health`.
